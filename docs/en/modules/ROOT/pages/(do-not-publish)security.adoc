== Introduction to Security in Module Federation

Module Federation is a powerful feature that enables developers to share and consume code dynamically across multiple applications. While it offers many benefits, it's essential to be mindful of the security implications and ensure that your implementation is secure and adheres to best practices.

== Identifying Security Challenges

Some of the key security challenges in Module Federation include:

- Unauthorized access to sensitive data or components;
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and potential vulnerabilities;
- Secure fetching of remote entries;
- Proper access control and permissions management.

== Best Practices for Security

To ensure that your Module Federation implementation is secure, follow these best practices:

=== Implement CORS Policies

When sharing modules across different domains, it's essential to implement appropriate CORS policies to prevent unauthorized access and protect your applications from potential security vulnerabilities. Configure your server to allow only trusted domains to access your federated modules.

=== Secure Remote Entries

Ensure that remote entries are protected from unauthorized access. Utilize authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth2, to secure your remote entry points.

=== Validate and Sanitize Inputs

When consuming federated modules, validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent potential security issues, such as code injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

== Managing Access Control

=== Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Implement RBAC to manage permissions and access to your federated modules based on user roles. This allows you to define granular permissions for each user role and control which modules they can access.

=== Utilize Dynamic Permissions

In some cases, you may need to implement dynamic permissions based on the user's context or other factors. Delegate modules can help you achieve this by allowing you to define custom logic for fetching remote entries and controlling access based on specific conditions.

== Implementing Secure Fetching

When fetching remote entries, consider the following best practices to enhance security:

=== Use Custom Fetch Clients

Utilize custom fetch clients that allow you to add custom headers, cookies, or bearer tokens to your fetch requests for enhanced security.

=== Leverage Secure Protocols

Ensure that you're using secure protocols, such as HTTPS, to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted between your applications and remote entries.

=== Implement Secure Storage

Store remote entry points securely, such as in databases with strong user-based access controls, to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.

== Monitoring and Auditing Security

Regularly monitor and audit your Module Federation implementation to identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to best practices. Employ logging, monitoring, and auditing tools to track access, detect anomalies, and maintain a secure environment.

== Conclusion

Security and permissions management is a critical aspect of any Module Federation implementation. By following best practices and implementing robust access controls, you can protect your applications from potential security vulnerabilities and ensure a secure, reliable, and scalable solution for sharing and consuming code across multiple applications.
